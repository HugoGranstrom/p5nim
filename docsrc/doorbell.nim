This uses the additional [p5sound](https://p5js.org/reference/#/libraries/p5.sound) library.
You will need to call `nbUseP5Sound` to use it in nimib.
Loading the sound file does not work when opening the html locally in a browser,
you will need to run a static server (e.g. [nimhttpd](https://github.com/h3rald/nimhttpd)).
